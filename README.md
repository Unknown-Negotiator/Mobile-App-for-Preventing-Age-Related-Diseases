# Mobile-App-for-Preventing-Age-Related-Diseases

In my third year, I collaborated with software engineering students to develop a mobile app aimed at helping postmenopausal women follow a disease prevention pro-gram. The program created by healthcare professionals consisted of exercises, diet tips, symptoms tracking, health testing, and more. I worked closely with doctors to under-stand their needs and translate them into software requirements. I also designed UI of the app, and took key part in the software architecture design. The app was tested by real patients and received very positive feedback.
